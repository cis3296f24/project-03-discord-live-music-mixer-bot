JOCKEYBOT 
This project will be a music bot for Discord that allows for an increasingly customized listening experience, such as audio reversal, increased/decreased playback speed, and other effects such as flangers, gain, reverb, and high/low pass filters. It will have a functional queue system and will support tracks across several streaming services to ensure an extensive music library will be available for all music tastes. It will also have a mashup feature, which will automatically lock the BPM of one track to another.
  

The most important class in this program will be a Player class which will wait for user input. It will frequently cite a Storage class which contains the tracks themselves, as well as a neighboring Web class dedicated to scraping the track from whichever streaming service is being requested (Soundcloud, Youtube, etc). Once the track is stored, it will be placed in the Storage queue if another track is playing, and it will be deleted as soon as the track is finished playing to save space. The storage class will operate in two loops; one will be dedicated to waiting for a track to be queued, and the other will allow users to queue for effects as a track plays. Most effects will have their own classes, however some effects (like playback speed or filtering) will be contained in the same class, assuming they accomplish essentially the same function in different directions. If the track queue loop in the Player class is quit, that will be the bot’s sign to leave the voice chat. That loop will effectively be the bot’s Main.
